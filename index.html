	  <p> I have very carefully chosen the color contrast of the body, background and the 
	      font, only using extra colors when necessary so that the overall theme remains
	      easy on the eyes (it's not dark for a reason heh). I kept telling other people
	      that they should have their own websites without actually creating one for myself
	      so I thought may be it's time to start doing that so here I am.

	     I'm probably going to have to move the site to a different place. Still figuring out
	     this web stuff. I don't know about you but my shitty K-12 education and even worse
	     college experience (which I ended up dropping out of) combined with a broken family 
	     and illerate toxic parents and somehow you just keep on going while wanting to kill
	     yourself is a pretty near schizo-turning line of events.
	  </p>
	  <p> At this point you're on the brink of insanity, quite really on the verge of 
	      suicide. Disturbing as it sounds, it's true. 
	  </p>
	  <p> You start valuing the basic facts of life, the kind of shit that makes you 
	      question everything, specifically abstract bullshit like "wisdom". That's been my 
	      introduction to "The Real World" where people KILL, RAPE and LIE because they think 
	      it's fun and oh, don't get me wrong, many openly admit to it. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	     So, you might ask "Why would I want to listen to a LARPer, who's also a retard, babble
	     about broad open-ended philosophical questions?" and I'd tell you that you don't have 
	     to! You can continue preparing for meme exams or get back to your daily wagecuckery,
	     or whatever I could not care less.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	     How is it that I'm alive after all this time and still manage to stay sane while 
	     having literally no real-life friends or close loved ones? Why I am not dead yet? 
	     Well, if you the curious kind you'd easily be able to relate with this. Because it 
	     feels good when you figure something out on your own without much help, it feels 
	     good when you finally understand how a program works! It feels nice when you figure 
	     out an application of some abstract, at first, nonsensical seeming piece of math that 
	     you had never thought you'd be able to understand or EVER apply to anything concrete 
	     :3
	  </p>
	  <p>
	     Little things like that, over time create a snow ball effect. Not something one could
	     have guessed in high school, I think. And remember there's always fun in 
	     "fun-damental"! and don't lookup it's etymology FFS :P
	  </p>
	  <p>
	     BTW <a href="https://noai.duckduckgo.com">ddg</a> without AI slop is pretty nice. Now 
	     I prefer shit that specifically opts out of the LLM crap. Yes it's a feature for me.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	     I don't have time to hold grudges so here's a great html 
	     <a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/">tutorial</a>, ENJOY :D
	  </p>
	  <p>
	     FWIW the generic AI + web slop is different from experts using local models that are 
	     very specialized and working on non-trivial problems in complexity or information 
	     theory. Important distinction worth noting. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
 	     I might add a tor mirror later if I ever feel that the stuff I'm posting here is
	     getting too edgy.
