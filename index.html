	  <p> I have very carefully chosen the color contrast of the body, background and the 
	      font, only using extra colors when necessary so that the overall dark theme  
	      remains easy on the eyes. <br>I kept telling other people that they should have 
	      their own websites without actually creating one for myself so I thought may be
	      it's time to start doing that so here I am.
