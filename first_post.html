	  Just got done with Crime and Punishment. Here's an excerpt from the book: </br>

	  -- </br>
	  On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked, Raskolnikov lay 
	  on his plank bed and thought of her. He had even fancied that day that all the 
	  convicts who had been his enemies looked at him differently; he had even entered 
	  into talk with them and they answered him in a friendly way. He remembered that 
	  now, and thought it was bound to be so. Wasn’t everything now bound to be changed?
	  </p>
	  <p> He thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented her and 
	  wounded her heart. He remembered her pale and thin little face. But these 
	  recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what infinite love he would 
	  now repay all her sufferings. And what were all, all the agonies of the past! 
	  Everything, even his crime, his sentence and imprisonment, seemed to him now in 
	  the first rush of feeling an external, strange fact with which he had no concern. 
	  But he could not think for long together of anything that evening, and he could 
	  not have analysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped 
	  into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out 
	  in his mind. Under his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically.

	  The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read the raising of 
	  Lazarus to him. At first he was afraid that she would worry him about religion, 
	  would talk about the gospel and pester him with books. But to his great surprise 
	  she had not once approached the subject and had not even offered him the 
	  Testament. He had asked her for it himself not long before his illness and she 
	  brought him the book without a word. Till now he had not opened it. He did not 
	  open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: “Can her convictions not 
	  be mine now? Her feelings, her aspirations at least....” She too had been greatly 
	  agitated that day, and at night she was taken ill again. But she was so happy—and 
	  so unexpectedly happy—that she was almost frightened of her happiness. Seven 
	  years, only seven years! At the beginning of their happiness at some moments they 
	  were both ready to look on those seven years as though they were seven days.

	  He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would 
	  have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great suffering.
	  But that is the beginning of a new story—the story of the gradual renewal of a 
	  man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into 
	  another, of his initiation into a new unknown life. That might be the subject of 
	  a new story, but our present story is ended. </br>
